cert-manager has been deployed! 

Please validate the service is running by checking if the pod is running, its logs to make sure there are no errors, and that the CRDs have been successfully installed.

```
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
kubectl logs -n cert-manager <cert-manager pod>
kubectl get crds | grep certmanager
```

In order to begin issuing certificates, you will need to set up an Issuer (namespace-scoped) or a ClusterIssuer (cluster-scoped).
