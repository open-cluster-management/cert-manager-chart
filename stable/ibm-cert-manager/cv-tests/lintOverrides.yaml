- reason: "Cert-manager and its subcharts only runs on master nodes."
  rule: "PodHasArchBasedNodeAffinity"
- reason: "In ICP 3.2.0 and above, cert-manager is installed before the calico network is available and image manager requires cert-manager. In order for it to work, it must use the host network."
  rule: "NoHostNetwork"
- reason: "ICP retags all of its charts to the version of ICP, so it's not technically going to be the version in dev."
  rule: "ChartNameVersionClassificationMatch"
- reason: "Cert-manager uses the default service account on its namespace and doesn't need to create its own"
  rule: "ServiceAccountHasPullSecret"
- reason: "Cert-manager and its subcharts uses the default service account on its namespace and doesn't need to create its own"
  rule: "ServiceAccountHasSANamespacePullSecret"
- reason: "Having an application test will mess with the shared testing environment since we are a platform service."
  rule: "AppTestMustExist"
- reason: "If the helm chart supports earlier versions than ICP 3.2, it is acceptable to leave qualification.levelName: ibm-cloud-pak so that older versions of ICP display the IBM Cloud Pak badge"
  message: "qualification.levelName will not be valid for future versions of ICP: 'ibm-cloud-pak'"
- reason: "Host network must be enabled for cert-manager and its subchart components since cert-manager will be installed first during an ICP install (before calico network) and it requires the host network to function properly. The other PSP keys have been added"
  rule: "PodSecurityInPodSecurityContext"
- reason: "According to this page (http://icp-content-playbook.rch.stglabs.ibm.com/designing-content/ilmt-licensing/), IBM Cloud Private is not on the list to include metering annotations"
  rule : "MeteringAnnotationLabels"
